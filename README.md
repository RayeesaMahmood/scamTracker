**Tackling Scams in the Digital Age:**
An Engineering Student’s Vision for Safer Cyber Practices
In today’s hyper-connected world, the convenience of technology often comes with hidden risks. Scams through phone calls, malicious links, and fraudulent QR codes are rampant, particularly in countries like India, where millions fall victim to cyber fraud annually. While police cybercrime units are actively addressing these threats with advanced tools and expertise, there’s a pressing need for grassroots innovation.
As an engineering student passionate about cybersecurity, I’ve embarked on a journey to develop a solution that empowers individuals to protect themselves from such scams. This project aims to leverage cutting-edge technology to build a comprehensive mobile application capable of detecting and mitigating phone scams and QR code frauds.
